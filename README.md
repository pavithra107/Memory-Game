 # Memory Game Project

This project is designed to work on all modern devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc).


## How to play

#### In each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
* During the game you can press the Refresh button to clear the board, shuffle the cards and start again.
